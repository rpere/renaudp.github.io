After 1 year of using the van, discovered so many great places. Sometimes in legit campgrounds, sometimes in remote areas (what is called dispersed camping). UT, CA and AZ are so far the states that we've been in.

Owning a van is not for everyone. I would say that the #1 key aptitude one must have is to be both mechanically and handy capable. The reason why I am saying this is because the cost associated to owning a van and think both from a maintenance / upgrade perspective, is very high. It seems that everything is either $2k, $5k or $10k and I'm not joking here - here is a little explanation : 
- Our sprinter van is considered lightweight (~7,500lbs loaded) that means with fuel and water and gears.
- OEM suspensions on these vans are terrible, if you have never drove a van you cannot understand the importance of these. A van is high profile vehicle, that weights a lot, and when driving under windy conditions, it is a very stressful experience because the handling becomes terrible. The #1 thing to do on your van is to upgrade the suspensions, and this again is a lot of money + labor to do it ! I insist, this is not a "nice to have" this is a "must do and have" for your own safety, the safety of others on the road, and your overall driving experience - you will spend many hours driving this thing so you better be happy driving it!
- Space management in a van is critical, every square inches you can squeeze is important for your well beeing. This means investing in any kind of outdoor/indoor/roof storage and while the choice is very broad, it costs a lot of money to buy these products. Then you need to mount it, if you can't do it yourself, it's also a lot of labor you will have to pay someone to do it for you. 
- Regular mainteance / fixing things - it's a moving vehicle, doing 1000's of miles you will need to do things as simple as oil & filter changes very often, and sometimes more complicated things, and knowning how to do it yourself, will save you so much time and money.

Choosing the layout of your van is very important as well. You need to seriously think about what you MUST have and not.
For example, some van have indoor showers (this is a huge debate within the community) - some people consider this as a must have, and while I respect the choice of everyone, I would disagree on this. I think having an indoor shower is a huge waste of space. Here's why: having an indoor shower (at least the permanently built ones) means that 95% of the time you will not be able to use that space for something else. 

Realistically you will not shower more than 5min / day. Shower needs water, and again this is not your typical 5th wheel, you can only bring so much water with you, so your water capacity will be very very limited and you might end up using your shower every 2 days or so instead... in the end do you really need that shower ?!

This is one example, of many others choices you will need to make when chosing the layout of a van, others things like (garage space, seating, bedding etc..)

Another big choice : 2WD or 4x4/AWD - this is really long topic that can be better addressed by doing research online. I would just say summarize the decision to this : do you consider yourself a good navigator (read : you know/feel where to go and how when you are off pavement roads) if the answer is yes, 99% of the time you will be satisfied with the 2WD - they are RWD (i.e Rear Wheel Drive) and properly loaded (i.e weight is usually on the rear) they are incredibly capable off-road (granted you have decent ground clearance and good tires / suspension).

Sprinter vans comes in 3 sizes : 
* 144 WB (2 adults 1 child max)
* 170 WB (4 persons max)
* 170 ext WB (I'd still say 4 persons max, but perhaps this is the best rig to have that permanently fixed shower)

Favorite places we have been so far after 10,000 miles
* in CA : 
  * Anza-borrego desert - we love going off the trails and camp in remote areas - it is truly beautiful out there and the feeling of being in the middle of nowhere is very real.

  * Early fall / Winter mountain camping - lots of places in the National Forests ; we stayed once at skypark campground and had the campground for ourself during winter time. It was really awesome
